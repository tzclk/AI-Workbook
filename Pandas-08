 
Data Input and Output
This notebook is the reference code for getting input and output, pandas can read a variety of 
file types using its pd.read_ methods. Let's take a look at the most common data types:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

CSV
CSV Input

df = pd.read_csv('example')
df


a	b	c	d
0	0	1	2	3
1	4	5	6	7
2	8	9	10	11
3	12	13	14	15

CSV Output

df.to_csv('example',index=False)

Excel
Pandas can read and write excel files, keep in mind, this only imports data. Not formulas or images, having images or macros may cause this read_excel method to crash.

Excel Input

pd.read_excel('Excel_Sample.xlsx',sheetname='Sheet1')

a	b	c	d
0	0	1	2	3
1	4	5	6	7
2	8	9	10	11
3	12	13	14	15

Excel Output

df.to_excel('Excel_Sample.xlsx',sheet_name='Sheet1')



HTML
You may need to install htmllib5,lxml, and BeautifulSoup4. In your terminal/command prompt run:

conda install lxml
conda install html5lib
conda install BeautifulSoup4

Then restart Jupyter Notebook. (or use pip install if you aren't using the Anaconda Distribution)

Pandas can read table tabs off of html. For example:


HTML Input
Pandas read_html function will read tables off of a webpage and return a list of DataFrame objects:


df = pd.read_html('http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html')

SQL (Optional)
Note: If you are completely unfamiliar with SQL you can check out my other course: "Complete SQL Bootcamp" to learn SQL.
The pandas.io.sql module provides a collection of query wrappers to both facilitate data retrieval and to reduce dependency 
on DB-specific API. Database abstraction is provided by SQLAlchemy if installed. In addition you will need a driver library 
for your database. Examples of such drivers are psycopg2 for PostgreSQL or pymysql for MySQL. For SQLite this is included in 
Python’s standard library by default. You can find an overview of supported drivers for each SQL dialect in the SQLAlchemy docs.

If SQLAlchemy is not installed, a fallback is only provided for sqlite (and for mysql for backwards compatibility, 
but this is deprecated and will be removed in a future version). This mode requires a Python database adapter which 
respect the Python DB-API.

See also some cookbook examples for some advanced strategies.

The key functions are:

read_sql_table(table_name, con[, schema, ...])
Read SQL database table into a DataFrame.
read_sql_query(sql, con[, index_col, ...])
Read SQL query into a DataFrame.
read_sql(sql, con[, index_col, ...])


Read SQL query or database table into a DataFrame.

DataFrame.to_sql(name, con[, flavor, ...])

Write records stored in a DataFrame to a SQL database.


from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')
df.to_sql('data', engine)
sql_df = pd.read_sql('data',con=engine)
sql_df

index	a	b	c	d
0	0	0	1	2	3
1	1	4	5	6	7
2	2	8	9	10	11
3	3	12	13	14	15
Great Job!
