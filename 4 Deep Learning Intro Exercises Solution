Exercise 1

The Pima Indians dataset is a very famous dataset distributed by UCI and originally collected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It contains data from clinical exams for women age 21 and above of Pima indian origins. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

It has the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
The last colum is the outcome, and it is a binary variable.

In this first exercise we will explore it through the following steps:

Load the ..data/diabetes.csv dataset, use pandas to explore the range of each feature
For each feature draw a histogram. Bonus points if you draw all the histograms in the same figure.
Explore correlations of features with the outcome column. You can do this in several ways, for example using the sns.pairplot we used above or drawing a heatmap of the correlations.
Do features need standardization? If so what stardardization technique will you use? MinMax? Standard?
Prepare your final X and y variables to be used by a ML model. Make sure you define your target variable well. Will you need dummy columns?



df = pd.read_csv('../data/diabetes.csv')
df.head()
_ = df.hist(figsize=(12, 10))

import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(df, hue='Outcome')
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot = True)
df.info()
df.describe()
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from keras.utils import to_categorical
sc = StandardScaler()
X = sc.fit_transform(df.drop('Outcome', axis=1))
y = df['Outcome'].values
y_cat = to_categorical(y)
X.shape
y_cat.shape





Exercise 2

Build a fully connected NN model that predicts diabetes. Follow these steps:

Split your data in a train/test with a test size of 20% and a random_state = 22
define a sequential model with at least one inner layer. You will have to make choices for the following things:
what is the size of the input?
how many nodes will you use in each layer?
what is the size of the output?
what activation functions will you use in the inner layers?
what activation function will you use at output?
what loss function will you use?
what optimizer will you use?
fit your model on the training set, using a validation_split of 0.1
test your trained model on the test data from the train/test split
check the accuracy score, the confusion matrix and the classification report



X.shape
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y_cat,
                                                    random_state=22,
                                                    test_size=0.2)
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, input_shape=(8,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(Adam(lr=0.05),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
model.summary()
32*8 + 32
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, verbose=2, validation_split=0.1)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
y_test_class = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)
y_pred_class = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
pd.Series(y_test_class).value_counts() / len(y_test_class)
accuracy_score(y_test_class, y_pred_class)
print(classification_report(y_test_class, y_pred_class))
confusion_matrix(y_test_class, y_pred_class)




Exercise 3

Compare your work with the results presented in this notebook. Are your Neural Network results better or worse than the results obtained by traditional Machine Learning techniques?

Try training a Support Vector Machine or a Random Forest model on the exact same train/test split. Is the performance better or worse?
Try restricting your features to only 4 features like in the suggested notebook. How does model performance change?
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
â€‹
for mod in [RandomForestClassifier(), SVC(), GaussianNB()]:
    mod.fit(X_train, y_train[:, 1])
    y_pred = mod.predict(X_test)
    print("="*80)
    print(mod)
    print("-"*80)
    print("Accuracy score: {:0.3}".format(accuracy_score(y_test_class,
                                                         y_pred)))
    print("Confusion Matrix:")
    print(confusion_matrix(y_test_class, y_pred))
    print()
    
    
    
Exercise 4

Tensorflow playground is a web based neural network demo. It is really useful to develop an intuition about what happens when you change architecture, activation function or other parameters. Try playing with it for a few minutes. You don't nee do understand the meaning of every knob and button in the page, just get a sense for what happens if you change something. In the next chapter we'll explore these things in more detail.
