#Categorical Data Plots
Now let's discuss using seaborn to plot categorical data! There are a few main plot types for this:

factorplot
boxplot
violinplot
stripplot
swarmplot
barplot
countplot
Let's go through examples of each!


import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline


tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
tips.head()



barplot and countplot
These very similar plots allow you to get aggregate data off a categorical feature in your data. 
barplot is a general plot that allows you to aggregate the categorical data based off some function, by default the mean:



sns.barplot(x='sex',y='total_bill',data=tips)


import numpy as np

sns.barplot(x='sex',y='total_bill',data=tips,estimator=np.std)




#countplot
This is essentially the same as barplot except the estimator is explicitly counting 
the number of occurrences. Which is why we only pass the x value:

sns.countplot(x='sex',data=tips)



#boxplot and violinplot

sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,palette='rainbow')


# Can do entire dataframe with orient='h'
sns.boxplot(data=tips,palette='rainbow',orient='h')

sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="smoker",data=tips, palette="coolwarm")


sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,palette='rainbow')

sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,hue='sex',palette='Set1')

sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,hue='sex',split=True,palette='Set1')





#stripplot and swarmplot
The stripplot will draw a scatterplot where one variable is categorical. 
A strip plot can be drawn on its own, but it is also a good complement to a box or violin plot 
in cases where you want to show all observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution.

The swarmplot is similar to stripplot(), but the points are adjusted (only along the categorical axis)
so that they donâ€™t overlap. This gives a better representation of the distribution of values, 
although it does not scale as well to large numbers of observations (both in terms of the ability 
to show all the points and in terms of the computation needed to arrange them).


sns.stripplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)

sns.stripplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,jitter=True)

sns.stripplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,jitter=True,hue='sex',palette='Set1')

sns.stripplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips,jitter=True,hue='sex',palette='Set1',split=True)



sns.swarmplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)

sns.swarmplot(x="day", y="total_bill",hue='sex',data=tips, palette="Set1", split=True)





#Combining Categorical Plots

sns.violinplot(x="tip", y="day", data=tips,palette='rainbow')
sns.swarmplot(x="tip", y="day", data=tips,color='black',size=3)





#factorplot
factorplot is the most general form of a categorical plot. It can take in a kind parameter to adjust the plot type:


sns.factorplot(x='sex',y='total_bill',data=tips,kind='bar')
